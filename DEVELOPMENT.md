# Development Guideline/Conventions

Just a dump for right now. In construction... Maybe a wiki would also be a good place for this.

## Setup

- Install the recommended VSCode extensions. This includes `pylint` (Python linting) and `black` (Python formatting). VSCode is setup via the `settings.json` to format on save.
- Install [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html).
- Install the dependencies: `pipenv install`


## TODO
- Setup `.editorconfig` for non-VSCode users. At least provide very basic setup like max line length etc.
- A [`justfile`](https://github.com/casey/just) would also be beneficial.
