# ResultWizard

TODO (at the very end): [Making a PyPI-friendly README](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/making-a-pypi-friendly-readme/)

## Checklist
- [ ] GPG key setup to sign commits
- [ ] Recommended VSCode extensions installed (especially the formatter. It should automatically format on every save!)
- [ ] on branch `value-wizard` with latest commit pulled
- [ ] Read the [`README.md`](https://github.com/paul019/ValueWizard/tree/value-wizard/src#code-structure) in the `src` folder (to get to know the code structure) & see our [feature list](https://github.com/paul019/ValueWizard/issues/16)
- [ ] search for "TODO"s in the code, they will guide you to the next steps
- [ ] document and append to `tests/playground.py` what we expect as user when using this library (we will use this as a reference to test the library later on)
- [ ] try to add doc-strings early on (in relevant places), so that I know what you are doing (and you know what I'm doing :))
- [ ] discuss when you want to restructure `domain` objects (e.g. `_Value`), e.g. if you are annoyed of having to deal with strings instead of floats (but I think with strings we are more flexible)
