# Python to LaTeX

This package uses reflections to read the values of your global python variables and export them to LaTeX. This makes possible a seemless integrated workflow between Jupyter notebooks and LaTeX publications.

## Example code

```
# Your python code...

from python_to_latex import export
export(globals())
```

## TODO

Add documentation.
