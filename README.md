    <p><strong>Intelligent interface between Python-computed values and your LaTeX work</strong></p>

Annoyed of having to copy around values from Python code to your LaTeX work? Think of `ResultWizard` as an interface between the two. Export any variables from Python including possible uncertainties and their units and directly reference them in your LaTeX document.

> [!Warning]  
> ResultWizard is still in its *alpha* stage. We're happy to receive your feedback, e.g. report any bugs. But note that the API might still change before we hit the first stable release 1.0.0.
