## Little bit of history
This project started out at the end of 2023 under the name `python2latex` when [*Paul Obernolte*](https://github.com/paul019) was working on reports for the practical parts of the physics curriculum at the University of Heidelberg. In these reports, experimental data was processed in Python and many results had to be included in LaTeX. The manual copy-paste process was error-prone and took too much time, so he started this project. Originally, it just consisted of one single file, that got the job done.

In 2024, the project was renamed to `ResultWizard` as [*Dominic Plein*](https://github.com/splines) joined the team. Together, we completely redesigned the project, added new features and improved the code quality with linting, tests, CI/CD and a modular clean architecture approach. We set up a branding, published first alpha releases to PyPI and started this documentation. We learned many things along the way and are proud to have published our first Python package.

We hope that `ResultWizard` will help you save time and make dealing with data in Python and LaTeX more enjoyable. If you have any feedback, please let us know on [GitHub](https://github.com/resultwizard/ResultWizard/issues). If you like the project, consider starring it on GitHub as we're always happy to see that people find our work (we're doing in our free-time) useful.


## The future (plans for 2024)

As of mid-April 2024, we're still in the alpha stage. But the first stable release is not that far away. We want to make sure we ship a solid product you can rely on, so expect a few more months of alpha testing. We're happy to receive your feedback until the first stable release. After this release, we plan to maintain the project (especially with regards to security fixes). But we will probably add new features only sparingly (in an effort to keep the API stable and in the light of our limited free-time resources).


## Acknowledgements

We like to thank the many great people in our surroundings who have helped make this project see the light of the day. We're grateful for the support of our friends, family and colleagues, both mentally and in the form of very concrete feedback as alpha testers. We also want to thank the open-source community for providing us with so many great tools and libraries, among others: [`siunitx`](https://github.com/josephwright/siunitx) by Joseph Wright, [`plum`](https://github.com/beartype/plum) by Wessel Bruinsma and other contributors as well as [`pylint`](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/) by Pierre Sassoulas and others. We also want to thank the whole `Python` and `LaTeX` communities for providing us with such powerful tools to work with in the first place. And the [`just-the-docs`](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) contributors for such an amazing Docs theme. Thank you all! üôè
